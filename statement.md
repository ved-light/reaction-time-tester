# Project Statement

## Problem Statement
[cite_start]Individuals seeking to improve their reflexes for gaming or sports lack a simple, lightweight, and offline tool to accurately benchmark there reaction time to visual stimuli without complex GUI overhead[cite: 99]

## Scope of the Project
This project is an console-based aplication restricted to the Windows platform. It focuses on:
* Generating unpredictable visual stimuli
* Capturing user input events with low latency
* [cite_start]Calculating the exact time difference between the stimulus and the response[cite: 100]

## Target Users
* **Gamers:** To practice reaction speeds for competetive gaming.
* **Students:** For demonstrating simple input-output and timing in Python.
* [cite_start]**General Users:** Anyone interested in testing their cognitive reflex speed[cite: 102].

## High-Level Features
1.  **Stimulus Generation:** Random time-delay logic
2.  **Input Validation:** Logic to detect and reject premature inputs
3.  **Time Calculation:** High-precision stopwatch functionality using system time.
4.  [cite_start]**User Feedback:** Immediate console output of results and game loop control[cite: 103]
